# Setup
## Carthage
```
carthage bootstrap --platform ios
```

# Goal:
## Functional Requirements:
- [x] Exchange rates must be fetched from: https://currencylayer.com/documentation
- [x] User must be able to select a currency from a list of currencies available from the API
- [x] User should then see a list of exchange rates for the selected currency
- [x] Rates should be persisted locally and refreshed no more frequently than every 30 minutes (to limit bandwidth usage)
- [x] Message the HR coordinator to get a API Access Key for using the API.

## UI Suggestion:
- [x] Some way to select a currency
- [x] A list/grid of exchange rates
- [x] It doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to be functional ;)

## What we're looking for:
- [x] An App that meets the Functional Requirements above
- [x] Your coding style! Show us how you like to write your code
- [x] Architecture, how you've structured your code
- [x] Principles, how you belive code should be written
